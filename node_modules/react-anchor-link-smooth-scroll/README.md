# React Anchor Link Smooth Scroll

React component for anchor links using the [smoothscroll](https://github.com/iamdustan/smoothscroll) polyfill.

## Instructions

1. Install dependency: `npm install react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll`

2. Add script
    ```js
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
    import AnchorLink from 'react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll'

    const SmoothScroll = () => (
      <div>
        <AnchorLink href='#things'>Things</AnchorLink>
        <AnchorLink href='#stuff'>Stuff</AnchorLink>

        <section id='things'>
          <h2>Things</h2>
        </section>
        <section id='stuff'>
          <h2>Stuff</h2>
        </section>
      </div>
    )

    ReactDOM.render(
      <SmoothScroll />,
      document.getElementById('content')
    )
    ```

3. Options; offset the amount of pixels from the top, for if you have a sticky navigation.
    * Regular offset

      ```js
       <AnchorLink offset='100' href='#things'>Things</AnchorLink>
      ```

    * For responsive offset you can provide a function returning the needed integer to scroll from

      ```js
       <AnchorLink offset={() => 100} href='#things'>Things</AnchorLink>
      ```
